    <h1>The Equalizer - Help & FAQ</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is The Equalizer?</h2>
        <p>
            The Equalizer is a simple, powerful app for planning events where costs need to be shared fairly among
            a group of people. Whether you're organizing a large convention, a small wedding, a family vacation,
            or any trip where expenses should be split, The Equalizer makes it easy to track who paid for what
            and calculate each person's fair share.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>The Goal:</strong> Spread event costs equally among those putting on the event, while allowing
            others to contribute through a shared Treasury that offsets everyone's costs.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>

        <h3><span class="icon">1️⃣</span>Create Your Event</h3>
        <p>Start by creating an event and adding members who will participate.</p>

        <h3><span class="icon">2️⃣</span>Choose Contributing Members</h3>
        <p>
            Select which members are <strong>Contributing Members</strong>—those who will share costs equally.
            Others can be marked as <strong>Reimbursement-Only</strong> if they paid for something but won't
            contribute equally to the overall costs.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="icon">3️⃣</span>Track Expenses</h3>
        <p>
            Add expenses as they happen. Mark who paid, how much, and whether the expense should be
            reimbursable or not. The app automatically calculates how much each contributing member owes.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="icon">4️⃣</span>Build the Treasury</h3>
        <p>
            Accept donations into the shared Treasury. These donations offset costs for everyone sharing
            the load. Donors can choose to be anonymous or publicly acknowledged.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="icon">5️⃣</span>Settle Up</h3>
        <p>
            View the Settlement page to see who should contribute to the Treasury and who should be
            reimbursed from it. The app shows exactly how much each person owes or is owed.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

        <div class="feature">
            <div class="feature-title"><span class="icon">👥</span>Contributing Members</div>
            <p>
                People who agree to share the event costs equally. The app calculates each contributing
                member's fair share based on total reimbursable expenses divided by the number of contributors.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
            <div class="feature-title"><span class="icon">💰</span>Treasury</div>
            <p>
                A shared fund that holds donations from members who want to contribute more than their
                fair share. Treasury donations offset costs for everyone, reducing what each contributing
                member needs to pay.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
            <div class="feature-title"><span class="icon">🎁</span>Treasury Donations</div>
            <p>
                Direct contributions to the Treasury fund. These can be anonymous or publicly acknowledged.
                Anyone can donate—they don't have to be a contributing member. This is perfect for
                generous individuals who want to "be a hero" and help offset costs for everyone else.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
            <div class="feature-title"><span class="icon">💸</span>Direct Donations (to Expenses)</div>
            <p>
                Money given directly from one member to another to help pay for a specific expense.
                This reduces the amount that needs to be reimbursed from the Treasury.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
            <div class="feature-title"><span class="icon">🚫</span>Non-Reimbursable Expenses</div>
            <p>
                Some expenses shouldn't be shared (like personal purchases or optional add-ons).
                Mark these as "Non-reimbursable" and they won't be included in the settlement calculations.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
            <div class="feature-title"><span class="icon">📊</span>Settlement</div>
            <p>
                The final calculation showing who should contribute to the Treasury and who should be
                reimbursed from it. This page shows exactly how to settle all debts fairly.

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Common Scenarios</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example: Family Vacation</strong><br>
            Three siblings plan a week-long beach house rental. They're all contributing members who will
            split costs equally. Their parents want to help but not split costs—they make a $500 Treasury
            donation. This reduces what each sibling owes from $400 to $233 each.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example: Wedding</strong><br>
            The bride and groom are contributing members. Parents pay for major expenses but are marked
            as reimbursement-only (they should be paid back but aren't sharing ongoing costs). Friends
            contribute Treasury donations as wedding gifts. The app tracks who paid what and calculates
            how much the couple needs to reimburse parents after accounting for Treasury gifts.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example: Conference Booth</strong><br>
            Five team members share booth costs equally. One member offers to contribute extra and makes
            a $200 Treasury donation on top of their fair share. Another team member pays for lunch and
            marks it as non-reimbursable (it's their treat). The Treasury donation reduces everyone else's
            share by $50 each.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-question">Q: What's the difference between Treasury donations and Direct donations?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>Treasury donations</strong> go into a shared fund that offsets costs for all contributing
            members equally. <strong>Direct donations</strong> are given from one specific member to another
            to help pay for a particular expense.
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">Q: Can someone donate to the Treasury if they're not a contributing member?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Yes! Anyone can contribute to the Treasury—they don't need to be splitting costs. This is perfect
            for supporters, sponsors, or generous friends who want to help offset expenses.
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">Q: What if someone paid for something but doesn't want to be reimbursed?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Mark the expense as "Non-reimbursable." This records who paid for it but doesn't include it in
            settlement calculations. Perfect for gifts, treats, or optional personal expenses.
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">Q: How does "Reimbursement-Only" member status work?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Reimbursement-only members have paid for expenses and should be reimbursed, but they're not
            expected to contribute equally like contributing members. Think of parents paying for wedding
            expenses—they should be paid back, but they're not splitting ongoing costs.
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">Q: Can I use this for a simple event with no Treasury donations?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Absolutely! Just add members, track expenses, and view the Settlement. The app works perfectly
            for straightforward cost-splitting even if no one contributes extra to the Treasury.
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">Q: How does the app calculate each person's share?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            The app adds up all reimbursable expenses, subtracts Treasury donations and direct contributions,
            then divides the remaining amount equally among contributing members. Each person's balance shows
            what they've paid minus their fair share.
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">Q: What's the difference between Free and Pro versions?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <strong>Free:</strong> Track one event locally on your device (no cloud sync).<br>
            <strong>Pro:</strong> Create unlimited events, sync across devices with Firebase, and share events
            with others using invite codes so everyone can see real-time updates.
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">Q: Can I share an event with other people so they can see the costs?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Yes, with Pro! Swipe right on any event to generate a 6-character invite code. Share that code
            with others and they can join the event to see real-time updates as expenses and donations are
            added. (Requires Pro subscription and all participants to be signed in.)
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">Q: Can I edit an expense after adding it?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Yes! Tap the expense on the Expenses page to edit its details—description, amount, who paid,
            notes, or whether it's reimbursable.
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question">Q: What if I make a mistake?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            You can delete any member, expense, or donation by swiping left on it in the list. You can also
            edit expenses and members by tapping on them.
        </div>

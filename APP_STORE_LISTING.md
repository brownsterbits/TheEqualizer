THE SIMPLE WAY TO SHARE EVENT COSTS FAIRLY

Planning a wedding? Family vacation? Conference booth? Group trip? The Equalizer makes splitting expenses simple, transparent, and fair—no spreadsheets, no confusion, no awkward money conversations.

WHAT MAKES THE EQUALIZER DIFFERENT

Most expense apps just split bills. The Equalizer goes further with a unique Treasury system that lets generous friends, family, or sponsors contribute extra to offset costs for everyone. It's perfect for events where some people want to help more than others.

HOW IT WORKS

1. CREATE YOUR EVENT
Set up your event and add participants in seconds.

2. CHOOSE WHO SHARES COSTS
Mark which members are splitting costs equally ("Contributing Members") and which just need reimbursement for expenses they covered.

3. TRACK EVERY EXPENSE
Record who paid for what as expenses happen. Mark whether each expense should be reimbursed or not (like personal purchases or optional add-ons).

4. BUILD THE TREASURY
Accept donations from anyone who wants to contribute extra. These donations offset costs for everyone sharing the load. Donors can be anonymous or publicly acknowledged—perfect for wedding gifts, generous relatives, or event sponsors.

5. SETTLE UP INSTANTLY
View exactly who should contribute to the Treasury and who should be reimbursed from it. No math, no confusion, just fair splits.

KEY FEATURES

• Treasury System - Accept donations that reduce everyone's share
• Contributing Members - Choose who splits costs equally
• Direct Donations - Track money given directly between members
• Non-Reimbursable Expenses - Mark personal or optional purchases
• Real-Time Calculations - Always see current balances
• Edit Anything - Fix mistakes by editing expenses or members

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES

Family Vacation: Three siblings split beach house costs equally. Parents contribute $500 to the Treasury as a gift. Each sibling's share drops from $400 to $233.

Wedding: Couple tracks all expenses. Parents cover major costs (marked for reimbursement). Friends contribute Treasury donations as gifts. App calculates exactly how much to reimburse parents after applying gifts.

Conference Booth: Five team members share booth costs. One generous member contributes extra $200 to Treasury. Everyone else's share reduces by $50 each.
